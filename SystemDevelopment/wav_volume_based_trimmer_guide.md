# Volume-Based Trimming of WAV Files using Python

## Overview

This Python script is a tool for processing WAV format audio files. It cuts out a specified duration of audio from the point where a given volume threshold is exceeded. It's mainly used for removing silent portions at the beginning of audio files and starting the cut from where the actual audio content begins.

## Prerequisites

To use this script, you need:

- Python 3.x
- The following Python libraries:
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - wave

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy
```

## Script Contents

The script consists mainly of the following parts:

1. Importing necessary libraries
2. The `trim_audio` function for processing audio files
3. The `main` function for handling command-line arguments and executing the main process

## Detailed Functionality

### Main Features

- Reading WAV format audio files
- Detecting the position where the specified volume threshold is exceeded
- Cutting out audio data of a specified length from the detected position
- Saving the cut audio data as a new WAV file

### Usage

Use the script from the command line as follows:

```bash
python wav_volume_based_trimmer.py <input_file> [options]
```

Example:

```bash
python wav_volume_based_trimmer.py input.wav -o output.wav -t 0.05 -d 2.0
```

### Options

- `-o, --output_file`: Path of the output file (default: trimmed_<input_file>)
- `-t, --threshold`: Volume threshold (0.0 - 1.0, default: 0.1)
- `-d, --duration`: Length to cut out (in seconds, default: 1.0)

### Process Flow

1. Load the input WAV file
2. Normalize audio data (convert to range -1.0 to 1.0)
3. For stereo audio, take the average of channels
4. Detect the first position exceeding the specified threshold
5. Cut out data of the specified length from the detected position
6. Save the cut data as a new WAV file

## Notes

- Input files must always be in WAV format.
- Specify the volume threshold (threshold) between 0.0 and 1.0.
- Specify the cut-out length (duration) in seconds.
- Stereo audio will be converted to mono.
- The output file is saved in 16-bit PCM format.

## Troubleshooting

- Error: Input file not found
  - Check if the specified file path is correct.
  - Check if you have access rights to the directory containing the file.

- Error: Problem occurred while reading input file
  - Check if the file is not corrupted.
  - Verify that the file is actually in WAV format.

- Warning: No volume exceeding the threshold was found
  - The threshold may be too high. Try a lower threshold.
  - The overall volume of the audio file may be low.

- Error: Problem occurred while writing output file
  - Check if you have write permissions for the output directory.
  - Ensure there's enough free disk space.

## Summary

This script is useful for removing unnecessary silent portions from WAV audio files and cutting out a fixed duration of audio from a specified volume level. It can be used for preprocessing audio data or extracting specific audio segments. It's easy to use from the command line, and parameters such as threshold and cut-out length can be customized.
