## Overview
This script takes a WAV format audio file as input and generates a spectrogram image of the audio. A spectrogram is a time-frequency representation of an audio signal, useful for visually analyzing the characteristics of sound.

## Prerequisites
To run this script, you'll need:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- The following Python libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - SciPy

You can install these libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Script Contents
The script consists of the following main parts:

1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Defining the `create_spectrogram` function
   - Loading the audio file
   - Calculating the spectrogram
   - Generating and saving the spectrogram image
3. Main section
   - Specifying input audio file and output image file
   - Calling the `create_spectrogram` function

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.io import wavfile
from scipy.signal import spectrogram

def create_spectrogram(input_audio, output_image):
    # Load the audio file
    sample_rate, samples = wavfile.read(input_audio)
    
    # Compute the frequency spectrum using FFT
    frequencies, times, spec = spectrogram(samples, fs=sample_rate)
    
    # Draw the spectrogram image
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
    Z = 10. * np.log10(spec)
    plt.imshow(Z, origin='lower', aspect='auto', cmap='viridis')
    plt.xlabel('Time')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency (Hz)')
    plt.colorbar(label='Intensity (dB)')
    plt.title('Spectrogram')
    
    # Save as an image
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig(output_image)
    plt.close()
    print(f"Spectrogram image has been saved as {output_image}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_audio = "input_audio.wav"  # Input audio file
    output_image = "spectrogram.png"  # Output image file
    create_spectrogram(input_audio, output_image)
```

## Detailed Functionality
- Input: WAV format audio file
- Output: PNG format spectrogram image
- Spectrogram characteristics:
  - X-axis: Time
  - Y-axis: Frequency
  - Color map: Represents intensity (dB) using the 'viridis' colormap

## Usage
Run the script from the command line as follows:
```bash
python audio-to-spectrogram.py
```

## Important Notes
- The input audio file should be placed in the same directory as the script with the name `input_audio.wav`.
- The output image file will be saved as `spectrogram.png` by default.
- Processing large audio files may increase memory usage.

## Troubleshooting
1. Error: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'input_audio.wav'`
   - Solution: Ensure that the input audio file is correctly placed in the script's directory.

2. Error: `ImportError: No module named 'numpy'` (or other library names)
   - Solution: Verify that the required libraries are installed. If needed, install them using the command in the "Prerequisites" section.

3. If the generated image is blank or unclear
   - Solution: Check if the input audio file is loaded correctly and contains audio data.

## Summary
This script allows you to easily generate spectrogram images from audio files. The resulting spectrogram visually represents the temporal changes and frequency components of the audio signal, which is useful for audio analysis and processing tasks.

To adjust the script's behavior or output, you can modify parameters within the `create_spectrogram` function (e.g., `figsize`, `cmap`) to customize the spectrogram display.
